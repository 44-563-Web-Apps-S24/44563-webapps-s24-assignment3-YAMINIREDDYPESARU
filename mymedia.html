    <h1>Yamini Reddy Pesaru</h1>
    <p>Saalar:In the year 1985, Deva and Vardharaja "Vardha" 
        Mannar are inseparable companions in Khansaar, 
        a puissant city-state ruled by Vardha's father, Raja Mannar. 
        After Raja Mannar, the chief of the Mannar tribe, commands the decimation of the 
        Shouryaanga tribe, a mob pounces on Deva and his mother at their residence, 
        but Vardha intercedes for them and confers an important territory of his in exchange 
        for sparing their lives. Before exiting Khansaar, Deva vows to return on Vardha's call.
